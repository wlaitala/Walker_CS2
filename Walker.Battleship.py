Description: Battleship on a budget
Bugs: Sometimes there will be only three ships, presumably because the randints are assigning two ships to the same space
      Needs documentation

#________Tentative Algorithm__For Reg____________________

#Main
    #Create 5x5 board
    #Place 4 dots randomly throughout
    #send board to telling the user

#Telling the user
    #Show the user what the board looks like
    #Tell the user how many turns they have left (starting wiht 10)
    #Send to user takes a turn

#User takes a turn
    #Get user coordinates   
    #Determine if coordinates are valid
        #Is a spot on the board
        #Is not taken by a guess already
        #Make this it's own function???
    #Determine if they are a hit/miss
        #if hit, replace with X
