ACT I

SCENE I Venice A street

  Roderigo and Iago

RODERIGO
Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly
That thou Iago who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine st know of this

IAGO
Sblood but you will not hear me
If ever I did dream of such a matter
Abhor me

RODERIGO
Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate

IAGO
Despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant
Off-cappd to him; and by the faith of man
I know my price I am worth no worse a place
But he as loving his own pride and purposes
Evades them with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuffd with epithets of war:
And in conclusion
Nonsuits my mediators: for Certes says he
I have already chose my officer
And what was he?
Forsooth a great arithmetician
One Michael Cassio a Florentine
A fellow almost damnd in a fair wife
That never set a squadron in the field
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen must be beleed and calmd
By debitor and creditor this counter-caster
He in good time must his lieutenant be
And I God bless the mark his Moorships ancient

RODERIGO
By heaven I rather  have been his hangman

IAGO
Why s no remedy Tis the curse of service
Preferment goes by letter and affection
And not by old gradation where each second
Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself
Whether I in any just term am affind
To love the Moor

RODERIGO
I  not follow him then

IAGO
O sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters nor all masters
Cannot be truly followd You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave
That doting on his own obsequious bondage
Wears out his time much like his masters ass
For nought but provender and when hes old cashierd
Whip me such honest knaves Others  are
Who trimmd in forms and visages of duty
Keep yet  hearts attending on themselves
And throwing but shows of service on  lords
Do well thrive by them and when they have lind  coats
Do themselves homage  fellows have some soul
And such a one do I profess myself For sir
It is as sure as you are Roderigo
Were I the Moor I  not be Iago:
In following him I follow but myself
Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
But seeming so for my peculiar end
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In complement extern tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am

RODERIGO
What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe
If he can carryt thus!

IAGO
Call up her father
Rouse him make after him poison his delight
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen
And though he in a fertile climate dwell
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy
Yet throw such changes of vexation ont
As it may lose some color

RODERIGO
Here is her fathers house Ill call aloud

IAGO
Do with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when by night and negligence the fire
Is spied in populous cities

RODERIGO
What ho Brabantio! Signior Brabantio ho!

IAGO
Awake! what ho Brabantio! Thieves thieves!
Look to your house your daughter and your bags!
Thieves thieves!

 Brabantio appears above at a window

BRABANTIO
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter ?

RODERIGO
Signior is all your family within?

IAGO
Are your doors locked?

BRABANTIO
Why wherefore ask you this?

IAGO
Zounds sir youre robbd for shame put on your gown
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul;
Even now now very now an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe Arise arise
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise I say

BRABANTIO
What have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO
Most reverend signior do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO
Not I What are you?

RODERIGO
My name is Roderigo

BRABANTIO
The worser welcome
I have chargd thee not to haunt about my doors;
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness
Being full of supper and distempering draughts
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
To start my quiet

RODERIGO
Sir sir sir

BRABANTIO
But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee

RODERIGO
Patience good sir

BRABANTIO
What tellst thou me of robbing?
This is Venice My house is not a grange

RODERIGO
Most grave Brabantio
In simple and pure soul I come to you

IAGO
Zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil
bid you Because we come to do you service and you think we are
ruffians youll have your daughter coverd with a Barbary horse;
youll have your nephews neigh to you; youll have coursers for cousins
and gennets for germans

BRABANTIO
What profane wretch art thou?

IAGO
I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are
now making the beast with two backs

BRABANTIO
Thou art a villain

IAGO
You are a senator

BRABANTIO
This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo

RODERIGO
Sir I will answer anything But I beseech you
If t be your pleasure and most wise consent
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter
At this odd-even and dull watch o the night
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire a gondolier
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:
If this be known to you and your allowance
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
But if you know not this my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
That from the sense of all civility
I thus  play and trifle with your reverence
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)
I say again hath made a gross revolt
Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you

BRABANTIO
Strike on the tinder ho!
Give me a taper! Call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream
Belief of it oppresses me already
Light I say light!

 [_Exit from above_]

IAGO
Farewell; for I must leave you:
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
To be producd as if I stay I shall
Against the Moor For I do know the state
However this may gall him with some check
Cannot with safety cast him for hes embarkd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
 even now stand in act that for  souls
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead  business In  regard
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains
Yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love
 is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search
And  will I be with him So farewell

 [_Exit_]

  Brabantio with Servants and torches

BRABANTIO
It is too true an evil Gone she is
And whats to come of my despised time
Is naught but bitterness Now Roderigo
Where didst thou see her? (O unhappy girl!)
With the Moor sayst thou? (Who  be a father!)
How didst thou know twas she? (O she deceives me
Past thought) What said she to you? Get more tapers
Raise all my kindred Are they married think you?

RODERIGO
Truly I think they are

BRABANTIO
O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
Fathers from hence trust not your daughters minds
By what you see them act Is  not charms
By  the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read Roderigo
Of some such thing?

RODERIGO
Yes sir I have indeed

BRABANTIO
Call up my brother O  you had had her!
Some one way some another Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO
I think I can discover him if you please
To get good guard and go along with me

BRABANTIO
Pray you lead on At every house Ill call
I may command at most Get weapons ho!
And raise some special officers of night
On good Roderigo I will deserve your pains

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE II Venice Another street

  Othello Iago and Attendants with torches

IAGO
Though in the trade of war I have slain men
Yet do I hold it very stuff o the conscience
To do no contrivd murder; I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerkd him here under the ribs

OTHELLO
Tis better as it is

IAGO
Nay but he prated
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honour
That with the little godliness I have
I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir
Are you fast married? Be assurd of this
That the magnifico is much belovd
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the dukes; he will divorce you
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law (with all his might to enforce it on)
Will give him cable

OTHELLO
Let him do his spite;
My services  I have done the signiory
Shall out-tongue his complaints Tis yet to know
 when I know that boasting is an honour
I shall promulgateI fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege And my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reachd For know Iago
But that I love the gentle Desdemona
I  not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the seas worth But look what lights come yond?

IAGO
Those are the raised father and his friends:
You were best go in

OTHELLO
Not I; I must be found
My parts my title and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly Is it they?

IAGO
By Janus I think no

  Cassio and Officers with torches

OTHELLO
The servants of the duke and my lieutenant
The goodness of the night upon you friends!
What is the news?

CASSIO
The duke does greet you general
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance
Even on the instant

OTHELLO
What is the matter think you?

CASSIO
Something from Cyprus as I may divine
It is a business of some heat The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one anothers heels;
And many of the consuls raisd and met
Are at the dukes already You have been hotly calld for
When being not at your lodging to be found
The senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out

OTHELLO
Tis well I am found by you
I will but spend a word here in the house
And go with you

 [_Exit_]

CASSIO
Ancient what makes he here?

IAGO
Faith he tonight hath boarded a land carrack:
If it prove lawful prize hes made forever

CASSIO
I do not understand

IAGO
Hes married

CASSIO
To who?

  Othello

IAGO
Marry toCome captain will you go?

OTHELLO
Have with you

CASSIO
Here comes another troop to seek for you

  Brabantio Roderigo and Officers with torches and weapons

IAGO
It is Brabantio General be advisd
He comes to bad intent

OTHELLO
Holla stand !

RODERIGO
Signior it is the Moor

BRABANTIO
Down with him thief!

 [_They draw on both sides_]

IAGO
You Roderigo! Come sir I am for you

OTHELLO
Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
Good signior you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons

BRABANTIO
O thou foul thief where hast thou stowd my daughter?
Damnd as thou art thou hast enchanted her
For Ill refer me to all things of sense
(If she in chains of magic were not bound)
Whether a maid so tender fair and happy
So opposite to marriage that she shunnd
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation
 ever have to incur a general mock
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
Of such a thing as thouto fear not to delight
Judge me the world if tis not gross in sense
That thou hast practisd on her with foul charms
Abusd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That weakens motion Ill havet disputed on;
Tis probable and palpable to thinking
I fore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world a practiser
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant
Lay hold upon him if he do resist
Subdue him at his peril

OTHELLO
Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest:
Were it my cue to fight I  have known it
Without a prompter Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?

BRABANTIO
To prison till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer

OTHELLO
What if I do obey?
How may the duke be with satisfied
Whose messengers are here about my side
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him?

OFFICER
Tis true most worthy signior
The dukes in council and your noble self
I am sure is sent for

BRABANTIO
How? The duke in council?
In this time of the night? Bring him away;
Mines not an idle cause The duke himself
Or any of my brothers of the state
Cannot but feel this wrong as twere  own
For if such actions may have passage free
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE III Venice A council chamber

 The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending

DUKE
 is no composition in  news
That gives them credit

FIRST SENATOR
Indeed they are disproportiond;
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys

DUKE
And mine a hundred and forty

SECOND SENATOR
And mine two hundred:
But though they jump not on a just account
(As in  cases where the aim reports
Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirm
A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus

DUKE
Nay it is possible enough to judgement:
I do not so secure me in the error
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense

SAILOR
[_Within_] What ho! what ho! what ho!

OFFICER
A messenger from the galleys

  Sailor

DUKE
Nowwhats the business?

SAILOR
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo

DUKE
How say you by this change?

FIRST SENATOR
This cannot be
By no assay of reason Tis a pageant
To keep us in false gaze When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk;
And let ourselves again but understand
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
So may he with more facile question bear it
For that it stands not in such warlike brace
But altogether lacks the abilities
That Rhodes is dressd in If we make thought of this
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
To leave that latest  concerns him first
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
To wake and wage a danger profitless

DUKE
Nay in all confidence hes not for Rhodes

OFFICER
Here is more news

  a Messenger

MESSENGER
The Ottomites reverend and gracious
Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes
Have  injointed them with an after fleet

FIRST SENATOR
Ay so I thought How many as you guess?

MESSENGER
Of thirty sail and now they do re-stem
 backward course bearing with frank appearance
 purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
Your trusty and most valiant servitor
With his free duty recommends you thus
And prays you to believe him

DUKE
Tis certain then for Cyprus
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town?

FIRST SENATOR
Hes now in Florence

DUKE
Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch

FIRST SENATOR
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor

  Brabantio Othello Iago Roderigo and Officers

DUKE
Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman
[_To Brabantio_] I did not see you; welcome gentle signior
We lackd your counsel and your help tonight

BRABANTIO
So did I yours Good your grace pardon me
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raisd me from my bed nor doth the general care
Take hold on me; for my particular grief
Is of so flood-gate and oerbearing nature
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself

DUKE
Why whats the matter?

BRABANTIO
My daughter! O my daughter!

DUKE and SENATORS
Dead?

BRABANTIO
Ay to me
She is abused stoln from me and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
Sans witchcraft could not

DUKE
Whoeer he be that in this foul proceeding
Hath thus beguild your daughter of herself
And you of her the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense yea though our proper son
Stood in your action

BRABANTIO
Humbly I thank your grace
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems
Your special mandate for the state affairs
Hath hither brought

ALL
We are very sorry for t

DUKE
[_To Othello_] What in your own part can you say to this?

BRABANTIO
Nothing but this is so

OTHELLO
Most potent grave and reverend signiors
My very noble and approvd good masters:
That I have taen away this old mans daughter
It is most true; true I have married her
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
And little blessd with the soft phrase of peace;
For since  arms of mine had seven years pith
Till now some nine moons wasted they have usd
 dearest action in the tented field
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle
And fore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
I will a round unvarnishd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love: what drugs what charms
What conjuration and what mighty magic
(For such proceeding I am charged withal)
I won his daughter

BRABANTIO
A maiden never bold:
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
Blushd at herself; and she in spite of nature
Of years of country credit everything
To fall in love with what she feard to look on!
It is judgement maimd and most imperfect
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature and must be driven
To find out practices of cunning hell
Why this  be I fore vouch again
That with some mixtures powerful oer the blood
Or with some dram conjurd to this effect
He wrought upon her

DUKE
To vouch this is no proof;
Without more wider and more overt test
Than  thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him

FIRST SENATOR
But Othello speak:
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Subdue and poison this young maids affections?
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth?

OTHELLO
I do beseech you
Send for the lady to the Sagittary
And let her speak of me before her father
If you do find me foul in her report
The trust the office I do hold of you
Not only take away but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life

DUKE
Fetch Desdemona hither

OTHELLO
Ancient conduct them you best know the place

 [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants_]

And till she come as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood
So justly to your grave ears Ill present
How I did thrive in this fair ladys love
And she in mine

DUKE
Say it Othello

OTHELLO
Her father lovd me oft invited me
Still questiond me the story of my life
From year to yearthe battles sieges fortunes
That I have passd
I ran it through even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
Of moving accidents by flood and field;
Of hair-breadth scapes i th imminent deadly breach;
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery of my redemption thence
And portance in my travelers history
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speaksuch was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath  ers This to hear
 Desdemona seriously incline
But still the house affairs  draw her thence
 ever as she could with haste dispatch
Shed come again and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse;  I observing
Took once a pliant hour and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I  all my pilgrimage dilate
Whereof by parcels she had something heard
But not intentively I did consent
And often did beguile her of her tears
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth sufferd My story being done
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs
She swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange;
Twas pitiful twas wondrous pitiful
She wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd
That heaven had made her such a man: she thankd me
And bade me if I had a friend that lovd her
I  but teach him how to tell my story
And that  woo her Upon this hint I spake:
She lovd me for the dangers I had passd
And I lovd her that she did pity them
This only is the witchcraft I have usd
Here comes the lady Let her witness it

   Desdemona Iago and Attendants

DUKE
I think this tale  win my daughter too
Good Brabantio
Take up this mangled matter at the best
Men do  broken weapons rather use
Than  bare hands

BRABANTIO
I pray you hear her speak
If she confess that she was half the wooer
Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Light on the man!Come hither gentle mistress:
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA
My noble father
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you You are the lord of duty
I am hitherto your daughter: but heres my husband
And so much duty as my mother showd
To you preferring you before her father
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord

BRABANTIO
God be with you! I have done
Please it your grace on to the state affairs
I had rather to adopt a child than get it
Come hither Moor:
I here do give thee that with all my heart
 but thou hast already with all my heart
I  keep from theeFor your sake jewel
I am glad at soul I have no other child
For thy escape  teach me tyranny
To hang clogs on themI have done my lord

DUKE
Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
 as a grise or step may help  lovers
Into your favour
When remedies are past the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst  late on hopes depended
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes
The robbd that smiles steals something from the thief;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief

BRABANTIO
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
We lose it not so long as we can smile;
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort  from thence he hears;
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
 sentences to sugar or to gall
Being strong on both sides are equivocal:
But words are words; I never yet did hear
That the bruisd heart was pierced through the ear
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state

DUKE
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the
fortitude of the place is best known to you And though we have  a
substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign
mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you: you must
fore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with
this more stubborn and boisterous expedition

OTHELLO
The tyrant custom most grave senators
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnize
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness and do undertake
This present wars against the Ottomites
Most humbly fore bending to your state
I crave fit disposition for my wife
Due reference of place and exhibition
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding

DUKE
If you please
Bet at her fathers

BRABANTIO
Ill not have it so

OTHELLO
Nor I

DESDEMONA
Nor I I  not  reside
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most gracious duke
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
And let me find a charter in your voice
T assist my simpleness

DUKE
What  you Desdemona?

DESDEMONA
That I did love the Moor to live with him
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my hearts subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord
I saw Othellos visage in his mind
And to his honours and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
So that dear lords if I be left behind
A moth of peace and he go to the war
The rites for  I love him are bereft me
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence Let me go with him

OTHELLO
Let her have your voice
Vouch with me heaven I fore beg it not
To please the palate of my appetite
Nor to comply with heat the young affects
In me defunct and proper satisfaction
But to be free and bounteous to her mind
And heaven defend your good souls that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me No when light-wingd toys
Of featherd Cupid seel with wanton dullness
My speculative and officd instruments
That my disports corrupt and taint my business
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation

DUKE
Be it as you shall privately determine
Either for her stay or going The affair cries haste
And speed must answer it

FIRST SENATOR
You must away tonight

OTHELLO
With all my heart

DUKE
At nine i the morning here well meet again
Othello leave some officer behind
And he shall our commission bring to you
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you

OTHELLO
So please your grace my ancient
A man he is of honesty and trust
To his conveyance I assign my wife
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me

DUKE
Let it be so
Good night to everyone [_To Brabantio_] And noble signior
If virtue no delighted beauty lack
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black

FIRST SENATOR
Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well

BRABANTIO
Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see:
She has deceivd her father and may thee

 [_Exeunt Duke Senators Officers &c_]

OTHELLO
My life upon her faith! Honest Iago
My Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her
And bring them after in the best advantage
Come Desdemona I have but an hour
Of love of worldly matters and direction
To spend with thee We must obey the time

 [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona_]

RODERIGO
Iago

IAGO
What sayst thou noble heart?

RODERIGO
What will I do thinkest thou?

IAGO
Why go to bed and sleep

RODERIGO
I will incontinently drown myself

IAGO
If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman!

RODERIGO
It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then have we a
prescription to die when death is our physician

IAGO
O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four times seven years
and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never
found man that knew how to love himself Ere I  say I  drown
myself for the love of a guinea-hen I  change my humanity with a
baboon

RODERIGO
What  I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not
in my virtue to amend it

IAGO
Virtue! a fig! Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies
are gardens to the  our wills are gardeners So that if we will
plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it
with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it
sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and
corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our
lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the
blood and baseness of our natures  conduct us to most preposterous
conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal
stings our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this that you call love to
be a sect or scion

RODERIGO
It cannot be

IAGO
It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be
a man Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me
thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of
perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now Put
money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an
usurped beard; I say put money in thy purse It cannot be that
Desdemona  long continue her love to the Moorput money in thy
pursenor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt
see an answerable sequestrationput but money in thy purse  Moors
are changeable in  wills Fill thy purse with money The food that
to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb
as the coloquintida She must change for youth When she is sated with
his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change
she must fore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn
thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money
thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian
and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the
tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her; fore make money A pox of
drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be
hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her

RODERIGO
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue?

IAGO
Thou art sure of me Go make money I have told thee often and I
retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted;
thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against
him: if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a
sport  are many events in the womb of time  will be
delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this
tomorrow Adieu

RODERIGO
Where shall we meet i the morning?

IAGO
At my lodging

RODERIGO
Ill be with thee betimes

IAGO
Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo?

RODERIGO
What say you?

IAGO
No more of drowning do you hear?

RODERIGO
I am changed Ill sell all my land

 [_Exit_]

IAGO
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse
For I mine own gaind knowledge  profane
If I  time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor
And it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets
He has done my office I know not if t be true
But I for mere suspicion in that kind
Will do as if for surety He holds me well
The better shall my purpose work on him
Cassios a proper man Let me see now
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery How how? Lets see
After some time to abuse Othellos ear
That he is too familiar with his wife
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected framd to make women false
The Moor is of a free and open nature
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are
I havet It is engenderd Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light

 [_Exit_]



ACT II

SCENE I A seaport in Cyprus A Platform

  Montano and two Gentlemen

MONTANO
What from the cape can you discern at sea?

FIRST GENTLEMAN
Nothing at all it is a high-wrought flood
I cannot twixt the heaven and the main
Descry a sail

MONTANO
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
A fuller blast neer shook our battlements
If it hath ruffiand so upon the sea
What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

SECOND GENTLEMAN
A segregation of the Turkish fleet
For do but stand upon the foaming shore
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
The wind-shakd surge with high and monstrous main
Seems to cast water on the burning Bear
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole;
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood

MONTANO
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not enshelterd and embayd they are drownd
It is impossible to bear it out

  a third Gentleman

THIRD GENTLEMAN
News lads! Our wars are done
The desperate tempest hath so bangd the Turks
That  designment halts A noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of  fleet

MONTANO
How? Is this true?

THIRD GENTLEMAN
The ship is here put in
A Veronessa; Michael Cassio
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello
Is come on shore; the Moor himself at sea
And is in full commission here for Cyprus

MONTANO
I am glad ont Tis a worthy governor

THIRD GENTLEMAN
But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest

MONTANO
Pray heavens he be;
For I have servd him and the man commands
Like a full soldier Lets to the sea-side ho!
As well to see the vessel thats come in
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard

THIRD GENTLEMAN
Come lets do so;
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance

  Cassio

CASSIO
Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
That so approve the Moor! O let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea

MONTANO
Is he well shippd?

CASSIO
His bark is stoutly timberd and his pilot
Of very expert and approvd allowance;
fore my hopes not surfeited to death
Stand in bold cure

[_Within_] A sail a sail a sail!

  a Messenger

CASSIO
What noise?

MESSENGER
The town is empty; on the brow o the sea
Stand ranks of people and they cry A sail!

CASSIO
My hopes do shape him for the governor

 [_A shot_]

SECOND GENTLEMAN
They do discharge  shot of courtesy
Our friends at least

CASSIO
I pray you sir go forth
And give us truth who tis that is arrivd

SECOND GENTLEMAN
I shall

 [_Exit_]

MONTANO
But good lieutenant is your general wivd?

CASSIO
Most fortunately: he hath achievd a maid
That paragons description and wild fame
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener

  second Gentleman

How now? Who has put in?

SECOND GENTLEMAN
Tis one Iago ancient to the general

CASSIO
He has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
The gutterd rocks and congregated sands
Traitors ensteepd to clog the guiltless keel
As having sense of beauty do omit
 mortal natures letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona

MONTANO
What is she?

CASSIO
She that I spake of our great captains captain
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago;
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A sennights speed Great Jove Othello guard
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship
Make loves quick pants in Desdemonas arms
Give renewd fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort!

  Desdemona Iago Roderigo and Emilia

O behold
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
Hail to thee lady! and the grace of heaven
Before behind thee and on every hand
Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA
I thank you valiant Cassio
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO
He is not yet arrived nor know I aught
But that hes well and will be shortly here

DESDEMONA
O but I fearHow lost you company?

[_Within_] A sail a sail!

CASSIO
The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship But hark! a sail

 [_Guns within_]

SECOND GENTLEMAN
They give  greeting to the citadel
This likewise is a friend

CASSIO
See for the news

 [_Exit Gentleman_]

Good ancient you are welcome [_To Emilia_] Welcome mistress
Let it not gall your patience good Iago
That I extend my manners; tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy

 [_Kissing her_]

IAGO
Sir  she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me
You  have enough

DESDEMONA
Alas she has no speech

IAGO
In faith too much
I find it still when I have list to sleep
Marry before your ladyship I grant
She puts her tongue a little in her heart
And chides with thinking

EMILIA
You have little cause to say so

IAGO
Come on come on; you are pictures out of doors
Bells in your parlours wild-cats in your kitchens
Saints in your injuries devils being offended
Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds

DESDEMONA
O fie upon thee slanderer!

IAGO
Nay it is true or else I am a Turk
You rise to play and go to bed to work

EMILIA
You shall not write my praise

IAGO
No let me not

DESDEMONA
What st thou write of me if thou st praise me?

IAGO
O gentle lady do not put me tot
For I am nothing if not critical

DESDEMONA
Come on assays one gone to the harbour?

IAGO
Ay madam

DESDEMONA
I am not merry but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how st thou praise me?

IAGO
I am about it but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours
And thus she is deliverd
If she be fair and wise fairness and wit
The ones for use the other useth it

DESDEMONA
Well praisd! How if she be black and witty?

IAGO
If she be black and to have a wit
Shell find a white that shall her blackness fit

DESDEMONA
Worse and worse

EMILIA
How if fair and foolish?

IAGO
She never yet was foolish that was fair
For even her folly helpd her to an heir

DESDEMONA
 are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i the alehouse What
miserable praise hast thou for her thats foul and foolish?

IAGO
s none so foul and foolish unto
But does foul pranks  fair and wise ones do

DESDEMONA
O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the worst best But what praise
couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the
authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice
itself?

IAGO
She that was ever fair and never proud
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud
Never lackd gold and yet went never gay
Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may;
She that being angerd her revenge being nigh
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly;
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cods head for the salmons tail;
She that could think and neer disclose her mind
See suitors following and not look behind;
She was a wight if ever such wight were

DESDEMONA
To do what?

IAGO
To suckle fools and chronicle small beer

DESDEMONA
O most lame and impotent conclusion!Do not learn of him Emilia
though he be thy husbandHow say you Cassio? is he not a most profane
and liberal counsellor?

CASSIO
He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in
the scholar

IAGO
[_Aside_] He takes her by the palm Ay well said whisper With as
little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile
upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true
tis so indeed If such tricks as  strip you out of your
lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers
so oft  now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good;
well kissed an excellent courtesy! Tis so indeed Yet again your
fingers to your lips?  they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

 [_Trumpets within_]

The Moor! I know his trumpet

CASSIO
Tis truly so

DESDEMONA
Lets meet him and receive him

CASSIO
Lo where he comes!

  Othello and Attendants

OTHELLO
O my fair warrior!

DESDEMONA
My dear Othello!

OTHELLO
It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me O my souls joy!
If after every tempest come such calms
May the winds blow till they have wakend death!
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high and duck again as low
As hells from heaven! If it were now to die
Twere now to be most happy for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate

DESDEMONA
The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts  increase
Even as our days do grow!

OTHELLO
Amen to that sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this and this the greatest discords be [_They kiss_]
That eer our hearts shall make!

IAGO
[_Aside_] O you are well tund now
But Ill set down the pegs that make this music
As honest as I am

OTHELLO
Come let us to the castle
News friends our wars are done the Turks are drownd
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey you shall be well desird in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them O my sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I dote
In mine own comfortsI prithee good Iago
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one and his worthiness
Does challenge much respectCome Desdemona
Once more well met at Cyprus

 [_Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants_]

IAGO
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour Come hither If thou best
valiantas they say base men being in love have then a nobility in
 natures more than is native to themlist me The lieutenant
tonight watches on the court of guard: first I must tell thee this:
Desdemona is directly in love with him

RODERIGO
With him? Why tis not possible

IAGO
Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what
violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her
fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy
discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed And what delight shall
she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act
of sport   be again to inflame it and to give satiety a
fresh appetite loveliness in favour sympathy in years manners and
beauties; all  the Moor is defective in: now for want of 
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused
begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature
will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir
this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who
stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a
knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere
form of civil and humane seeming for the better compassing of his salt
and most hidden loose affection? Why none why none! A slipper and
subtle knave a finder out of occasions; that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself: a
devilish knave! Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all
those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after A
pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already

RODERIGO
I cannot believe that in her she is full of most blessed condition

IAGO
Blest figs end! the wine she drinks is made of grapes: if she had been
blessed she  never have loved the Moor Blessed pudding! Didst
thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst not mark that?

RODERIGO
Yes that I did But that was but courtesy

IAGO
Lechery by this hand An index and obscure prologue to the history of
lust and foul thoughts They met so near with  lips that 
breaths embracd together Villainous thoughts Roderigo! When 
mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main
exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish! But sir be you ruled by
me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight For the command
Ill layt upon you Cassio knows you not Ill not be far from you Do
you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course you please 
the time shall more favourably minister

RODERIGO
Well

IAGO
Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply with his
truncheon may strike at you: provoke him that he may for even out of
that will I cause  of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall
come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall
then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed
without the   were no expectation of our prosperity

RODERIGO
I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity

IAGO
I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel: I must fetch his
necessaries ashore Farewell

RODERIGO
Adieu

 [_Exit_]

IAGO
That Cassio loves her I do well believe it;
That she loves him tis apt and of great credit:
The Moor howbeit that I endure him not
Is of a constant loving noble nature;
And I dare think hell prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband Now I do love her too
Not out of absolute lust (though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin)
But partly led to diet my revenge
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leapd into my seat The thought whereof
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am evend with him wife for wife
Or failing so yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgement cannot cure  thing to do
If this poor trash of Venice whom I trash
For his quick hunting stand the putting on
Ill have our Michael Cassio on the hip
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
(For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too)
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness Tis here but yet confusd
Knaverys plain face is never seen till usd

 [_Exit_]

SCENE II A street

  Othellos Herald with a proclamation

HERALD
It is Othellos pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon
certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the
Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph: some to dance some
to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addition leads
him For besides  beneficial news it is the celebration of his
nuptial So much was his pleasure  be proclaimed All offices are
open and  is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of
five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus
and our noble general Othello!

 [_Exit_]

SCENE III A Hall in the Castle

  Othello Desdemona Cassio and Attendants

OTHELLO
Good Michael look you to the guard tonight
Lets teach ourselves that honourable stop
Not to outsport discretion

CASSIO
Iago hath direction what to do
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
Will I look tot

OTHELLO
Iago is most honest
Michael good night Tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you [_To Desdemona_] Come my dear love
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue;
That profits yet to come tween me and you
Good night

 [_Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants_]

  Iago

CASSIO
Welcome Iago We must to the watch

IAGO
Not this hour lieutenant Tis not yet ten o th clock Our general
cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona; who let us not
fore blame: he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove

CASSIO
Shes a most exquisite lady

IAGO
And Ill warrant her full of game

CASSIO
Indeed she is a most fresh and delicate creature

IAGO
What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley to provocation

CASSIO
An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest

IAGO
And when she speaks is it not an alarm to love?

CASSIO
She is indeed perfection

IAGO
Well happiness to  sheets! Come lieutenant I have a stoup of
wine; and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that  fain
have a measure to the health of black Othello

CASSIO
Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for
drinking I could well wish courtesy  invent some other custom of
tainment

IAGO
O they are our friends; but one cup: Ill drink for you

CASSIO
I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too
and behold what innovation it makes here: I am unfortunate in the
infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more

IAGO
What man! Tis a night of revels The gallants desire it

CASSIO
Where are they?

IAGO
Here at the door I pray you call them in

CASSIO
Ill dot; but it dislikes me

 [_Exit_]

IAGO
If I can fasten but one cup upon him
With that  he hath drunk tonight already
Hell be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress dog Now my sick fool Roderigo
Whom love hath turnd almost the wrong side out
To Desdemona hath tonight carousd
Potations pottle-deep; and hes to watch:
Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
That hold  honours in a wary distance
The very elements of this warlike isle
Have I tonight flusterd with flowing cups
And they watch too Now mongst this flock of drunkards
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle But here they come:
If consequence do but approve my dream
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream

  Cassio Montano and Gentlemen; followed by Servant with wine

CASSIO
Fore God they have given me a rouse already

MONTANO
Good faith a little one; not past a pint as I am a soldier

IAGO
Some wine ho!
[_Sings_]

    _And let me the cannikin clink clink
    And let me the cannikin clink clink:
        A soldiers a man
        O mans lifes but a span
    Why then let a soldier drink_

Some wine boys!

CASSIO
Fore God an excellent song

IAGO
I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting:
your Dane your German and your swag-bellied Hollanderdrink ho!are
nothing to your English

CASSIO
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

IAGO
Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk; he sweats not
to overthrow your Almain; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next
pottle can be filled

CASSIO
To the health of our general!

MONTANO
I am for it lieutenant; and Ill do you justice

IAGO
O sweet England!

[_Sings_]

    _King Stephen was a worthy peer
        His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear
        With that he calld the tailor lown
    He was a wight of high renown
        And thou art but of low degree:
    Tis pride that pulls the country down
        Then take thine auld cloak about thee_

Some wine ho!

CASSIO
Fore God this is a more exquisite song than the other

IAGO
Will you hear t again?

CASSIO
No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things
Well Gods above all and  be souls must be saved and  be
souls must not be saved

IAGO
Its true good lieutenant

CASSIO
For mine own part no offence to the general nor any man of quality I
hope to be saved

IAGO
And so do I too lieutenant

CASSIO
Ay but by your leave not before me; the lieutenant is to be saved
before the ancient Lets have no more of this; lets to our affairs
Forgive us our sins! Gentlemen lets look to our business Do not
think gentlemen I am drunk This is my ancient this is my right
hand and this is my left I am not drunk now I can stand well enough
and I speak well enough

ALL
Excellent well

CASSIO
Why very well then You must not think then that I am drunk

 [_Exit_]

MONTANO
To the platform masters Come lets set the watch

IAGO
You see this fellow that is gone before
He is a soldier fit to stand by C√¶sar
And give direction: and do but see his vice
Tis to his virtue a just equinox
The one as long as th other Tis pity of him
I fear the trust Othello puts him in
On some odd time of his infirmity
Will shake this island

MONTANO
But is he often thus?

IAGO
Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
Hell watch the horologe a double set
If drink rock not his cradle

MONTANO
It were well
The general were put in mind of it
Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

  Roderigo

IAGO
[_Aside to him_] How now Roderigo?
I pray you after the lieutenant; go

 [_Exit Roderigo_]

MONTANO
And tis great pity that the noble Moor
 hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity:
It were an honest action to say so
To the Moor

IAGO
Not I for this fair island
I do love Cassio well and  do much
To cure him of this evil But hark! What noise?

[_Cry within_: Help! help!]

  Cassio driving in Roderigo

CASSIO
Zounds you rogue you rascal!

MONTANO
Whats the matter lieutenant?

CASSIO
A knave teach me my duty! Ill beat the knave into a twiggen bottle

RODERIGO
Beat me?

CASSIO
Dost thou prate rogue?

 [_Striking Roderigo_]

MONTANO
Nay good lieutenant;
I pray you sir hold your hand

CASSIO
Let me go sir
Or Ill knock you oer the mazard

MONTANO
Come come youre drunk

CASSIO
Drunk?

 [_They fight_]

IAGO
[_Aside to Roderigo_] Away I say! Go out and cry a mutiny

 [_Exit Roderigo_]

Nay good lieutenant Gods will gentlemen
Help ho!LieutenantsirMontanosir:
Help masters! Heres a goodly watch indeed!

 [_A bell rings_]

Whos that  rings the bell?Diablo ho!
The town will rise Gods will lieutenant hold
You will be shamd forever

  Othello and Attendants

OTHELLO
What is the matter here?

MONTANO
Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death

OTHELLO
Hold for your lives!

IAGO
Hold ho! lieutenantsirMontanogentlemen
Have you forgot all  place of sense and duty?
Hold! The general speaks to you; hold hold for shame!

OTHELLO
Why how now ho! From whence ariseth this?
Are we turnd Turks and to ourselves do that
 heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl:
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion
Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
From her propriety What is the matter masters?
Honest Iago that looks dead with grieving
Speak who began this? On thy love I charge thee

IAGO
I do not know Friends all but now even now
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then but now
As if some planet had unwitted men
Swords out and tilting one at others breast
In opposition bloody I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And  in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

OTHELLO
How comes it Michael you are thus forgot?

CASSIO
I pray you pardon me; I cannot speak

OTHELLO
Worthy Montano you were wont be civil
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: whats the matter
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? Give me answer to it

MONTANO
Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Your officer Iago can inform you
While I spare speech  something now offends me
Of all that I do know; nor know I aught
By me thats said or done amiss this night
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us

OTHELLO
Now by heaven
My blood begins my safer guides to rule
And passion having my best judgement collied
Assays to lead the way Zounds if I stir
Or do but lift this arm the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
How this foul rout began who set it on
And he that is approvd in this offence
Though he had twinnd with me both at a birth
Shall lose me What! in a town of war
Yet wild the peoples hearts brimful of fear
To manage private and domestic quarrel
In night and on the court and guard of safety?
Tis monstrous Iago who begant?

MONTANO
If partially affind or leagud in office
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth
Thou art no soldier

IAGO
Touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it  do offence to Michael Cassio
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general:
Montano and myself being in speech
 comes a fellow crying out for help
And Cassio following him with determind sword
To execute upon him Sir this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
Myself the crying fellow did pursue
Lest by his clamour (as it so fell out)
The town might fall in fright: he swift of foot
Outran my purpose: and I returnd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
And Cassio high in oath  till tonight
I neer might say before When I came back
(For this was brief) I found them close together
At blow and thrust even as again they were
When you yourself did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But men are men; the best sometimes forget;
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio I believe receivd
From him that fled some strange indignity
 patience could not pass

OTHELLO
I know Iago
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
But never more be officer of mine

  Desdemona attended

Look if my gentle love be not raisd up!
Ill make thee an example

DESDEMONA
Whats the matter?

OTHELLO
Alls well now sweeting; come away to bed
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
Lead him off

 [_Montano is led off_]

Iago look with care about the town
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
Come Desdemona: tis the soldiers life
To have  balmy slumbers wakd with strife

 [_Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio_]

IAGO
What are you hurt lieutenant?

CASSIO
Ay past all surgery

IAGO
Marry Heaven forbid!

CASSIO
Reputation reputation reputation! O I have lost my reputation! I
have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My
reputation Iago my reputation!

IAGO
As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound;
 is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle
and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without
deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute
yourself such a loser What man  are ways to recover the general
again: you are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy
than in malice even so as one  beat his offenceless dog to
affright an imperious lion: sue to him again and hes yours

CASSIO
I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander
with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk? and
speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse fustian with
ones own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name
to be known by let us call thee devil!

IAGO
What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he done to you?

CASSIO
I know not

IAGO
Ist possible?

CASSIO
I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly; a quarrel but
nothing wherefore O God that men  put an enemy in  mouths
to steal away  brains! That we  with joy pleasance revel
and applause transform ourselves into beasts!

IAGO
Why but you are now well enough: how came you thus recovered?

CASSIO
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath
One unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself

IAGO
Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the
condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not
befallen; but since it is as it is mend it for your own good

CASSIO
I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard!
Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer  stop them all To
be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast! O
strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessd and the ingredient is a
devil

IAGO
Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used
Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I
love you

CASSIO
I have well approved it sirI drunk!

IAGO
You or any man living may be drunk at a time man Ill tell you what
you shall do Our generals wife is now the general; I may say so in
this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess
yourself freely to her Importune her help to put you in your place
again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is
requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to
splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of
your love shall grow stronger than it was before

CASSIO
You advise me well

IAGO
I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness

CASSIO
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the
virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my fortunes
if they check me here

IAGO
You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch

CASSIO
Good night honest Iago

 [_Exit_]

IAGO
And whats he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit Shes framd as fruitful
As the free elements And then for her
To win the Moor weret to renounce his baptism
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin
His soul is so enfetterd to her love
That she may make unmake do what she list
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
Ill pour this pestilence into his ear
That she repeals him for her bodys lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good
She shall undo her credit with the Moor
So will I turn her virtue into pitch
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all

  Roderigo

How now Roderigo?

RODERIGO
I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one
that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight
exceedingly well cudgelled; and I think the issue will be I shall have
so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a
little more wit return again to Venice

IAGO
How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou knowst we work by wit and not by witchcraft
And wit depends on dilatory time
Doest not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee
And thou by that small hurt hast cashierd Cassio;
Though other things grow fair against the sun
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
Content thyself awhile By the mass tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted
Away I say thou shalt know more hereafter
Nay get thee gone

 [_Exit Roderigo_]

Two things are to be done
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress
Ill set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife Ay thats the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay

 [_Exit_]



ACT III

SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle

  Cassio and some Musicians

CASSIO
Masters play here I will content your pains
Something thats brief; and bid Good morrow general

 [_Music_]

  Clown

CLOWN
Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i
the nose thus?

FIRST MUSICIAN
How sir how?

CLOWN
Are  I pray you wind instruments?

FIRST MUSICIAN
Ay marry are they sir

CLOWN
O by hangs a tail

FIRST MUSICIAN
Whereby hangs a tale sir?

CLOWN
Marry sir by many a wind instrument that I know But masters heres
money for you: and the general so likes your music that he desires
you for loves sake to make no more noise with it

FIRST MUSICIAN
Well sir we will not

CLOWN
If you have any music that may not be heard tot again But as they
say to hear music the general does not greatly care

FIRST MUSICIAN
We have none such sir

CLOWN
Then put up your pipes in your bag for Ill away Go vanish into air
away!

 [_Exeunt Musicians_]

CASSIO
Dost thou hear mine honest friend?

CLOWN
No I hear not your honest friend I hear you

CASSIO
Prithee keep up thy quillets s a poor piece of gold for thee:
if the gentlewoman that attends the generals wife be stirring tell
her s one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech Wilt
thou do this?

CLOWN
She is stirring sir; if she will stir hither I shall seem to notify
unto her

CASSIO
Do good my friend

 [_Exit Clown_]

  Iago

In happy time Iago

IAGO
You have not been a-bed then?

CASSIO
Why no The day had broke
Before we parted I have made bold Iago
To send in to your wife My suit to her
Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access

IAGO
Ill send her to you presently
And Ill devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way that your converse and business
May be more free

CASSIO
I humbly thank you fort

 [_Exit Iago_]

I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest

  Emilia

EMILIA
Good morrow good lieutenant; I am sorry
For your displeasure but all will sure be well
The general and his wife are talking of it
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again

CASSIO
Yet I beseech you
If you think fit or that it may be done
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone

EMILIA
Pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely

CASSIO
I am much bound to you

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle

  Othello Iago and Gentlemen

OTHELLO
 letters give Iago to the pilot
And by him do my duties to the senate
That done I will be walking on the works
Repair  to me

IAGO
Well my good lord Ill dot

OTHELLO
This fortification gentlemen shall we seet?

GENTLEMEN
Well wait upon your lordship

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE III Cyprus The Garden of the Castle

  Desdemona Cassio and Emilia

DESDEMONA
Be thou assured good Cassio I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf

EMILIA
Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the cause were his

DESDEMONA
O thats an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were

CASSIO
Bounteous madam
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
Hes never anything but your true servant

DESDEMONA
I knowt I thank you You do love my lord
You have known him long; and be you well assurd
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a politic distance

CASSIO
Ay but lady
That policy may either last so long
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
Or breed itself so out of circumstance
That I being absent and my place supplied
My general will forget my love and service

DESDEMONA
Do not doubt that Before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place Assure thee
If I do vow a friendship Ill perform it
To the last article My lord shall never rest
Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift;
Ill intermingle everything he does
With Cassios suit fore be merry Cassio
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away

  Othello and Iago

EMILIA
Madam here comes my lord

CASSIO
Madam Ill take my leave

DESDEMONA
Why stay and hear me speak

CASSIO
Madam not now I am very ill at ease
Unfit for mine own purposes

DESDEMONA
Well do your discretion

 [_Exit Cassio_]

IAGO
Ha I like not that

OTHELLO
What dost thou say?

IAGO
Nothing my lord; or ifI know not what

OTHELLO
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

IAGO
Cassio my lord? No sure I cannot think it
That he  steal away so guilty-like
Seeing you coming

OTHELLO
I do believe twas he

DESDEMONA
How now my lord?
I have been talking with a suitor here
A man that languishes in your displeasure

OTHELLO
Who ist you mean?

DESDEMONA
Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord
If I have any grace or power to move you
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning
I have no judgement in an honest face
I prithee call him back

OTHELLO
Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA
Ay sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him Good love call him back

OTHELLO
Not now sweet Desdemon some other time

DESDEMONA
But shallt be shortly?

OTHELLO
The sooner sweet for you

DESDEMONA
Shallt be tonight at supper?

OTHELLO
No not tonight

DESDEMONA
Tomorrow dinner then?

OTHELLO
I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel

DESDEMONA
Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn
On Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not
Exceed three days In faith hes penitent;
And yet his trespass in our common reason
(Save that they say the wars must make examples
Out of  best) is not almost a fault
To incur a private check When shall he come?
Tell me Othello: I wonder in my soul
What you  ask me that I  deny
Or stand so mammering on What? Michael Cassio
That came a-wooing with you and so many a time
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
Hath taen your part to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me I could do much

OTHELLO
Prithee no more Let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing

DESDEMONA
Why this is not a boon;
Tis as I  entreat you wear your gloves
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted

OTHELLO
I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leave me but a little to myself

DESDEMONA
Shall I deny you? No farewell my lord

OTHELLO
Farewell my Desdemona Ill come to thee straight

DESDEMONA
Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you
Whateer you be I am obedient

 [_Exit with Emilia_]

OTHELLO
Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
But I do love thee! And when I love thee not
Chaos is come again

IAGO
My noble lord

OTHELLO
What dost thou say Iago?

IAGO
Did Michael Cassio when you wood my lady
Know of your love?

OTHELLO
He did from first to last Why dost thou ask?

IAGO
But for a satisfaction of my thought
No further harm

OTHELLO
Why of thy thought Iago?

IAGO
I did not think he had been acquainted with her

OTHELLO
O yes and went between us very oft

IAGO
Indeed?

OTHELLO
Indeed? Ay indeed Discernst thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

IAGO
Honest my lord?

OTHELLO
Honest? ay honest

IAGO
My lord for aught I know

OTHELLO
What dost thou think?

IAGO
Think my lord?

OTHELLO
Think my lord? By heaven he echoes me
As if  were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something
I heard thee say even now thou likst not that
When Cassio left my wife What didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed?
And didst contract and purse thy brow together
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me
Show me thy thought

IAGO
My lord you know I love you

OTHELLO
I think thou dost;
And for I know thourt full of love and honesty
And weighst thy words before thou givst them breath
fore  stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom; but in a man thats just
Theyre close dilations working from the heart
That passion cannot rule

IAGO
For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest

OTHELLO
I think so too

IAGO
Men  be what they seem;
Or those that be not  they might seem none!

OTHELLO
Certain men  be what they seem

IAGO
Why then I think Cassios an honest man

OTHELLO
Nay yet s more in this:
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words

IAGO
Good my lord pardon me
Though I am bound to every act of duty
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to
Utter my thoughts? Why say they are vile and false:
As wheres that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?

OTHELLO
Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
If thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts

IAGO
I do beseech you
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
As I confess it is my natures plague
To spy into abuses and of my jealousy
Shapes faults that are notthat your wisdom
From one that so imperfectly conceits
 take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
To let you know my thoughts

OTHELLO
What dost thou mean?

IAGO
Good name in man and woman dear my lord
Is the immediate jewel of  souls
Who steals my purse steals trash Tis something nothing;
Twas mine tis his and has been slave to thousands
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that  not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed

OTHELLO
By heaven Ill know thy thoughts

IAGO
You cannot if my heart were in your hand
Nor shall not whilst tis in my custody

OTHELLO
Ha?

IAGO
O beware my lord of jealousy;
It is the green-eyd monster  doth mock
The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss
Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger;
But O what damned minutes tells he oer
Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO
O misery!

IAGO
Poor and content is rich and rich enough;
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!

OTHELLO
Why why is this?
Thinkst thou Id make a life of jealousy
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No To be once in doubt
Is once to be resolvd: exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
Matching thy inference Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well;
Where virtue is  are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
Ill see before I doubt; when I doubt prove;
And on the proof  is no more but this:
Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO
I am glad of it for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: fore as I am bound
Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
I  not have your free and noble nature
Out of self-bounty be abusd Look tot
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show  husbands  best conscience
Is not to leave undone but keep unknown

OTHELLO
Dost thou say so?

IAGO
She did deceive her father marrying you;
And when she seemd to shake and fear your looks
She loved them most

OTHELLO
And so she did

IAGO
Why go to then
She that so young could give out such a seeming
To seal her fathers eyes up close as oak
He thought twas witchcraft But I am much to blame
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you

OTHELLO
I am bound to thee for ever

IAGO
I see this hath a little dashd your spirits

OTHELLO
Not a jot not a jot

IAGO
Trust me I fear it has
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love But I do see youre movd
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion

OTHELLO
I will not

IAGO
 you do so my lord
My speech  fall into such vile success
 my thoughts aimd not Cassios my worthy friend
My lord I see youre movd

OTHELLO
No not much movd
I do not think but Desdemonas honest

IAGO
Long live she so! And long live you to think so!

OTHELLO
And yet how nature erring from itself

IAGO
Ay s the point As to be bold with you
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime complexion and degree
Whereto we see in all things nature tends;
Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
But pardon me: I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her though I may fear
Her will recoiling to her better judgement
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent

OTHELLO
Farewell farewell:
If more thou dost perceive let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago

IAGO
[_Going_] My lord I take my leave

OTHELLO
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds

IAGO
[_Returning_] My lord I  I might entreat your honour
To scan this thing no further Leave it to time:
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place
For sure he fills it up with great ability
Yet if you please to hold him off awhile
You shall by that perceive him and his means
Note if your lady strain his tainment
With any strong or vehement importunity
Much will be seen in that In the meantime
Let me be thought too busy in my fears
(As worthy cause I have to fear I am)
And hold her free I do beseech your honour

OTHELLO
Fear not my government

IAGO
I once more take my leave

 [_Exit_]

OTHELLO
This fellows of exceeding honesty
And knows all qualities with a learned spirit
Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
Id whistle her off and let her down the wind
To prey at fortune Haply for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have or for I am declind
Into the vale of yearsyet thats not much
Shes gone I am abusd and my relief
Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage
That we can call  delicate creatures ours
And not  appetites! I had rather be a toad
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others uses Yet tis the plague of great ones
Prerogativd are they less than the base
Tis destiny unshunnable like death:
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken Desdemona comes
If she be false O then heaven mocks itself!
Ill not believet

  Desdemona and Emilia

DESDEMONA
How now my dear Othello?
Your dinner and the generous islanders
By you invited do attend your presence

OTHELLO
I am to blame

DESDEMONA
Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

OTHELLO
I have a pain upon my forehead here

DESDEMONA
Faith thats with watching twill away again;
Let me but bind it hard within this hour
It will be well

OTHELLO
Your napkin is too little;

 [_He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it_]

Let it alone Come Ill go in with you

DESDEMONA
I am very sorry that you are not well

 [_Exeunt Othello and Desdemona_]

EMILIA
I am glad I have found this napkin;
This was her first remembrance from the Moor
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Wood me to steal it But she so loves the token
For he conjurd her she  ever keep it
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to Ill have the work taen out
And givet Iago What he will do with it
Heaven knows not I
I nothing but to please his fantasy

  Iago

IAGO
How now? What do you here alone?

EMILIA
Do not you chide I have a thing for you

IAGO
A thing for me? It is a common thing

EMILIA
Ha?

IAGO
To have a foolish wife

EMILIA
O is that all? What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief?

IAGO
What handkerchief?

EMILIA
What handkerchief?
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
That  so often you did bid me steal

IAGO
Hast stoln it from her?

EMILIA
No faith she let it drop by negligence
And to the advantage I being here took t up
Look here it is

IAGO
A good wench give it me

EMILIA
What will you do witht that you have been so earnest
To have me filch it?

IAGO
[_Snatching it_] Why whats that to you?

EMILIA
If it be not for some purpose of import
Give t me again Poor lady shell run mad
When she shall lack it

IAGO
Be not acknown ont I have use for it
Go leave me

 [_Exit Emilia_]

I will in Cassios lodging lose this napkin
And let him find it Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ This may do something
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are in  natures poisons
 at the first are scarce found to distaste
But with a little act upon the blood
Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so

  Othello

Look where he comes Not poppy nor mandragora
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
 thou owdst yesterday

OTHELLO
Ha! ha! false to me?

IAGO
Why how now general? No more of that

OTHELLO
Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack
I swear tis better to be much abusd
Than but to knowt a little

IAGO
How now my lord?

OTHELLO
What sense had I of her stoln hours of lust?
I sawt not thought it not it harmd not me
I slept the next night well was free and merry;
I found not Cassios kisses on her lips
He that is robbd not wanting what is stoln
Let him not knowt and hes not robbd at all

IAGO
I am sorry to hear this

OTHELLO
I had been happy if the general camp
Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
So I had nothing known O now for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars
That make ambition virtue! O farewell
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
The spirit-stirring drum the ear-piercing fife
The royal banner and all quality
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats
The immortal Joves dread clamours counterfeit
Farewell! Othellos occupations gone!

IAGO
Ist possible my lord?

OTHELLO
Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore;
Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof
Or by the worth of mans eternal soul
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my wakd wrath

IAGO
Ist come to this?

OTHELLO
Make me to seet or at the least so prove it
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life!

IAGO
My noble lord

OTHELLO
If thou dost slander her and torture me
Never pray more Abandon all remorse;
On horrors head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazd;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that

IAGO
O grace! O heaven defend me!
Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?
God be wi you Take mine officeO wretched fool
That livst to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note take note O world
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence
Ill love no friend sith love breeds such offence

OTHELLO
Nay stay Thou st be honest

IAGO
I  be wise; for honestys a fool
And loses that it works for

OTHELLO
By the world
I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
Ill have some proof: her name that was as fresh
As Dians visage is now begrimd and black
As mine own face If  be cords or knives
Poison or fire or suffocating streams
Ill not endure t  I were satisfied!

IAGO
I see sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You  be satisfied?

OTHELLO
? Nay I will

IAGO
And may; but how? How satisfied my lord?
 you the supervisor grossly gape on
Behold her toppd?

OTHELLO
Death and damnation! O!

IAGO
It were a tedious difficulty I think
To bring them to that prospect Damn them then
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than  own! What then? How then?
What shall I say? Wheres satisfaction?
It is impossible you  see this
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
 lead directly to the door of truth
Will give you satisfaction you may havet

OTHELLO
Give me a living reason shes disloyal

IAGO
I do not like the office
But sith I am d in this cause so far
Prickd to t by foolish honesty and love
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleep
 are a kind of men so loose of soul
That in  sleeps will mutter  affairs
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona
Let us be wary let us hide our loves;
And then sir  he gripe and wring my hand
Cry O sweet creature! and then kiss me hard
As if he pluckd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips then laid his leg
Over my thigh and sighd and kissd and then
Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!

OTHELLO
O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO
Nay this was but his dream

OTHELLO
But this denoted a foregone conclusion
Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream

IAGO
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly

OTHELLO
Ill tear her all to pieces

IAGO
Nay but be wise Yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wifes hand?

OTHELLO
I gave her such a one twas my first gift

IAGO
I know not that: but such a handkerchief
(I am sure it was your wifes) did I today
See Cassio wipe his beard with

OTHELLO
If it be that

IAGO
If it be that or any that was hers
It speaks against her with the other proofs

OTHELLO
O that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor too weak for my revenge!
Now do I see tis true Look here Iago;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
Tis gone
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell!
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell bosom with thy fraught
For tis of aspics tongues!

IAGO
Yet be content

OTHELLO
O blood Iago blood!

IAGO
Patience I say Your mind perhaps may change

OTHELLO
Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Neer feels retiring ebb but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont;
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Shall neer look back neer ebb to humble love
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven
In the due reverence of a sacred vow [_Kneels_]
I here engage my words

IAGO
Do not rise yet [_Kneels_]
Witness you ever-burning lights above
You elements that clip us round about
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit hands heart
To wrongd Othellos service! Let him command
And to obey shall be in me remorse
What bloody business ever

 [_They rise_]

OTHELLO
I greet thy love
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
And will upon the instant put thee to t
Within  three days let me hear thee say
That Cassios not alive

IAGO
My friend is dead Tis done at your request
But let her live

OTHELLO
Damn her lewd minx! O damn her damn her!
Come go with me apart I will withdraw
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant

IAGO
I am your own for ever

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE IV Cyprus Before the Castle

  Desdemona Emilia and Clown

DESDEMONA
Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

CLOWN
I dare not say he lies anywhere

DESDEMONA
Why man?

CLOWN
Hes a soldier; and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing

DESDEMONA
Go to Where lodges he?

CLOWN
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie

DESDEMONA
Can anything be made of this?

CLOWN
I know not where he lodges; and for me to devise a lodging and say he
lies here or he lies  were to lie in mine own throat

DESDEMONA
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?

CLOWN
I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them
answer

DESDEMONA
Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his
behalf and hope all will be well

CLOWN
To do this is within the compass of mans wit and fore I will
attempt the doing it

 [_Exit_]

DESDEMONA
Where  I lose that handkerchief Emilia?

EMILIA
I know not madam

DESDEMONA
Believe me I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes And but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are it were enough
To put him to ill thinking

EMILIA
Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA
Who he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him

EMILIA
Look where he comes

  Othello

DESDEMONA
I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be calld to him How ist with you my lord?

OTHELLO
Well my good lady [_Aside_] O hardness to dissemble!
How do you Desdemona?

DESDEMONA
Well my good lord

OTHELLO
Give me your hand This hand is moist my lady

DESDEMONA
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow

OTHELLO
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
Much castigation exercise devout;
For heres a young and sweating devil here
That commonly rebels Tis a good hand
A frank one

DESDEMONA
You may indeed say so
For twas that hand that gave away my heart

OTHELLO
A liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts

DESDEMONA
I cannot speak of this Come now your promise

OTHELLO
What promise chuck?

DESDEMONA
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you

OTHELLO
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
Lend me thy handkerchief

DESDEMONA
Here my lord

OTHELLO
That  I gave you

DESDEMONA
I have it not about me

OTHELLO
Not?

DESDEMONA
No faith my lord

OTHELLO
That is a fault That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give
She was a charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it
T make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love But if she lost it
Or made a gift of it my fathers eye
 hold her loathed and his spirits  hunt
After new fancies: she dying gave it me
And bid me when my fate  have me wive
To give it her I did so; and take heed ont
Make it a darling like your precious eye
To loset or givet away were such perdition
As nothing else could match

DESDEMONA
Ist possible?

OTHELLO
Tis true s magic in the web of it
A sibyl that had numberd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses
In her prophetic fury sewd the work;
The worms were hallowd that did breed the silk
And it was dyed in mummy  the skillful
Conservd of maidens hearts

DESDEMONA
Indeed? Ist true?

OTHELLO
Most veritable fore look to t well

DESDEMONA
Then  to God that I had never seen t!

OTHELLO
Ha? wherefore?

DESDEMONA
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO
Ist lost? ist gone? speak is it out of the way?

DESDEMONA
Heaven bless us!

OTHELLO
Say you?

DESDEMONA
It is not lost but what and if it were?

OTHELLO
How?

DESDEMONA
I say it is not lost

OTHELLO
Fetcht let me see t

DESDEMONA
Why so I can sir but I will not now
This is a trick to put me from my suit
Pray you let Cassio be receivd again

OTHELLO
Fetch me the handkerchief! My mind misgives

DESDEMONA
Come come
Youll never meet a more sufficient man

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
I pray talk me of Cassio

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
Shard dangers with you

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA
In sooth you are to blame

OTHELLO
Away!

 [_Exit_]

EMILIA
Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA
I neer saw this before
Sure s some wonder in this handkerchief
I am most unhappy in the loss of it

EMILIA
Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs and we all but food;
They eat us hungerly and when they are full
They belch us

  Cassio and Iago

Look you Cassio and my husband

IAGO
 is no other way; tis she must do t
And lo the happiness! Go and importune her

DESDEMONA
How now good Cassio whats the news with you?

CASSIO
Madam my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour I  not be delayd
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Nor purposd merit in futurity
Can ransom me into his love again
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forcd content
And shut myself up in some other course
To fortunes alms

DESDEMONA
Alas thrice-gentle Cassio
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor  I know him
Were he in favour as in humour alterd
So help me every spirit sanctified
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you

IAGO
Is my lord angry?

EMILIA
He went hence but now
And certainly in strange unquietness

IAGO
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon
When it hath blown his ranks into the air
And like the devil from his very arm
Puffd his own brother and can he be angry?
Something of moment then I will go meet him
s matter int indeed if he be angry

DESDEMONA
I prithee do so

 [_Exit Iago_]

Something sure of state
Either from Venice or some unhatchd practice
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
Mens natures wrangle with inferior things
Though great ones are  object Tis even so
For let our finger ache and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods
Nor of them look for such observancy
As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
I was (unhandsome warrior as I am)
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had subornd the witness
And hes indicted falsely

EMILIA
Pray heaven it be state matters as you think
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you

DESDEMONA
Alas the day I never gave him cause!

EMILIA
But jealous souls will not be answerd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause
But jealous for they are jealous: tis a monster
Begot upon itself born on itself

DESDEMONA
Heaven keep that monster from Othellos mind!

EMILIA
Lady amen

DESDEMONA
I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout:
If I do find him fit Ill move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost

CASSIO
I humbly thank your ladyship

 [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia_]

  Bianca

BIANCA
Save you friend Cassio!

CASSIO
What make you from home?
How is it with you my most fair Bianca?
I faith sweet love I was coming to your house

BIANCA
And I was going to your lodging Cassio
What keep a week away? Seven days and nights?
Eight score eight hours and lovers absent hours
More tedious than the dial eight score times?
O weary reckoning!

CASSIO
Pardon me Bianca
I have this while with leaden thoughts been pressd
But I shall in a more continuate time
Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca

 [_Giving her Desdemonas handkerchief_]

Take me this work out

BIANCA
O Cassio whence came this?
This is some token from a newer friend
To the felt absence now I feel a cause
Ist come to this? Well well

CASSIO
Go to woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devils teeth
From whence you have them You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress some remembrance
No in good troth Bianca

BIANCA
Why whose is it?

CASSIO
I know not neither I found it in my chamber
I like the work well Ere it be demanded
As like enough it will Id have it copied
Take it and do t and leave me for this time

BIANCA
Leave you wherefore?

CASSIO
I do attend here on the general
And think it no addition nor my wish
To have him see me womand

BIANCA
Why I pray you?

CASSIO
Not that I love you not

BIANCA
But that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little
And say if I shall see you soon at night

CASSIO
Tis but a little way that I can bring you
For I attend here But Ill see you soon

BIANCA
Tis very good; I must be circumstancd

 [_Exeunt_]



ACT IV

SCENE I Cyprus Before the Castle

  Othello and Iago

IAGO
Will you think so?

OTHELLO
Think so Iago?

IAGO
What
To kiss in private?

OTHELLO
An unauthorizd kiss

IAGO
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO
Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm?
It is hypocrisy against the devil:
They that mean virtuously and yet do so
The devil  virtue tempts and they tempt heaven

IAGO
So they do nothing tis a venial slip
But if I give my wife a handkerchief

OTHELLO
What then?

IAGO
Why then tis hers my lord and being hers
She may I think bestowt on any man

OTHELLO
She is protectress of her honour too
May she give that?

IAGO
Her honour is an essence thats not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not:
But for the handkerchief

OTHELLO
By heaven I  most gladly have forgot it
Thou saidst (O it comes oer my memory
As doth the raven oer the infected house
Boding to all) he had my handkerchief

IAGO
Ay what of that?

OTHELLO
Thats not so good now

IAGO
What
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say (as knaves be such abroad
Who having by  own importunate suit
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress
Convinced or supplied them cannot choose
But they must blab)

OTHELLO
Hath he said anything?

IAGO
He hath my lord but be you well assurd
No more than hell unswear

OTHELLO
What hath he said?

IAGO
Faith that he didI know not what he did

OTHELLO
What? What?

IAGO
Lie

OTHELLO
With her?

IAGO
With her on her what you will

OTHELLO
Lie with her! lie on her!We say lie on her when they belie herLie
with her! thats fulsome Handkerchiefconfessionshandkerchief! To
confess and be hanged for his labour First to be hanged and then to
confess I tremble at it Nature  not invest herself in such
shadowing passion without some instruction It is not words that shake
me thus Pish! Noses ears and lips Ist
possible?Confess?handkerchief?O devil!

 [_Falls in a trance_]

IAGO
Work on
My medicine work! Thus credulous fools are caught
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
All guiltless meet reproach What ho! my lord!
My lord I say! Othello!

  Cassio

How now Cassio!

CASSIO
Whats the matter?

IAGO
My lord is fallen into an epilepsy
This is his second fit He had one yesterday

CASSIO
Rub him about the temples

IAGO
No forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course
If not he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs:
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
He will recover straight When he is gone
I  on great occasion speak with you

 [_Exit Cassio_]

How is it general? Have you not hurt your head?

OTHELLO
Dost thou mock me?

IAGO
I mock you? No by heaven
 you  bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO
A horned mans a monster and a beast

IAGO
s many a beast then in a populous city
And many a civil monster

OTHELLO
Did he confess it?

IAGO
Good sir be a man
Think every bearded fellow thats but yokd
May draw with you s millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
 they dare swear peculiar: your case is better
O tis the spite of hell the fiends arch-mock
To lip a wanton in a secure couch
And to suppose her chaste! No let me know
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be

OTHELLO
O thou art wise tis certain

IAGO
Stand you awhile apart
Confine yourself but in a patient list
Whilst you were here oerwhelmed with your grief
(A passion most unsuiting such a man)
Cassio came hither I shifted him away
And laid good scuse upon your ecstasy
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The  he promisd Do but encave yourself
And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew
Where how how oft how long ago and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife:
I say but mark his gesture Marry patience
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
And nothing of a man

OTHELLO
Dost thou hear Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
Butdost thou hear?most bloody

IAGO
Thats not amiss
But yet keep time in all Will you withdraw?

 [_Othello withdraws_]

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio (as tis the strumpets plague
To beguile many and be beguild by one)
He when he hears of her cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter Here he comes

  Cassio

As he shall smile Othello shall go mad
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassios smiles gestures and light behaviour
Quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant?

CASSIO
The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me

IAGO
Ply Desdemona well and you are sure ont
[_Speaking lower_] Now if this suit lay in Biancas power
How quickly  you speed!

CASSIO
Alas poor caitiff!

OTHELLO
[_Aside_] Look how he laughs already!

IAGO
I never knew a woman love man so

CASSIO
Alas poor rogue! I think i faith she loves me

OTHELLO
[_Aside_] Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out

IAGO
Do you hear Cassio?

OTHELLO
Now he importunes him
To tell it oer Go to well said well said

IAGO
She gives it out that you shall marry her
Do you intend it?

CASSIO
Ha ha ha!

OTHELLO
Do you triumph Roman? Do you triumph?

CASSIO
I marry her? What? A customer? I prithee bear some charity to my wit
do not think it so unwholesome Ha ha ha!

OTHELLO
So so so so They laugh that wins

IAGO
Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her

CASSIO
Prithee say true

IAGO
I am a very villain else

OTHELLO
Have you scored me? Well

CASSIO
This is the monkeys own giving out She is persuaded I will marry her
out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise

OTHELLO
Iago beckons me Now he begins the story

CASSIO
She was here even now She haunts me in every place I was the other
day talking on the sea-bank with certain Venetians and thither comes
the bauble and falls thus about my neck

OTHELLO
Crying O dear Cassio! as it were: his gesture imports it

CASSIO
So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me Ha ha
ha!

OTHELLO
Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O I see that nose of
yours but not that dog I shall throw it to

CASSIO
Well I must leave her company

IAGO
Before me! look where she comes

  Bianca

CASSIO
Tis such another fitchew! Marry a perfumd one
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA
Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you mean by that same
handkerchief you gave me even now? I was a fine fool to take it I must
take out the work? A likely piece of work that you  find it in
your chamber and not know who left it ! This is some minxs token
and I must take out the work?  give it your hobby-horse
Wheresoever you had it Ill take out no work ont

CASSIO
How now my sweet Bianca? How now how now?

OTHELLO
By heaven that  be my handkerchief!

BIANCA
If youll come to supper tonight you may If you will not come when
you are next prepared for

 [_Exit_]

IAGO
After her after her

CASSIO
Faith I must; shell rail in the street else

IAGO
Will you sup ?

CASSIO
Faith I intend so

IAGO
Well I may chance to see you for I  very fain speak with you

CASSIO
Prithee come will you?

IAGO
Go to; say no more

 [_Exit Cassio_]

OTHELLO
[_Coming forward_] How shall I murder him Iago?

IAGO
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO
O Iago!

IAGO
And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO
Was that mine?

IAGO
Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your
wife! she gave it him and he hath given it his whore

OTHELLO
I  have him nine years a-killing A fine woman a fair woman a
sweet woman!

IAGO
Nay you must forget that

OTHELLO
Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not
live No my heart is turned to stone; I strike it and it hurts my
hand O the world hath not a sweeter creature She might lie by an
emperors side and command him tasks

IAGO
Nay thats not your way

OTHELLO
Hang her I do but say what she is So delicate with her needle an
admirable musician! O she will sing the savageness out of a bear! Of
so high and plenteous wit and invention!

IAGO
Shes the worse for all this

OTHELLO
O a thousand a thousand times: and then of so gentle a condition!

IAGO
Ay too gentle

OTHELLO
Nay thats certain But yet the pity of it Iago! O Iago the pity of

IAGO
If you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if

IAGO
O tis foul in her

OTHELLO
With mine officer!

IAGO
Thats fouler

OTHELLO
Get me some poison Iago; this night Ill not expostulate with her
lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night Iago

IAGO
Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath
contaminated

OTHELLO
Good good The justice of it pleases Very good

IAGO
And for Cassio let me be his undertaker You shall hear more by
midnight

OTHELLO

OTHELLO
Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA

 [_Exit_]

LODOVICO
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO
He is much changd

LODOVICO
Are his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?

IAGO
Hes that he is I may not breathe my censure
What he might be If what he might he is not

LODOVICO

IAGO
Faith that was not so well; yet  I knew
That stroke  prove the worst!

LODOVICO
Is it his use?
Or did the letters work upon his blood
And new-create this fault?

IAGO
Alas alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known You shall observe him
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech: do but go after
And mark how he continues

LODOVICO
I am sorry that I am deceivd in him

 [_Exeunt_]

SCENE II Cyprus A Room in the Castle

  Othello and Emilia

OTHELLO
You have seen nothing then?

EMILIA
Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect

OTHELLO
Yes you have seen Cassio and she together

EMILIA
But then I saw no harm and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them

OTHELLO
What did they never whisper?

EMILIA
Never my lord

OTHELLO
Nor send you out o the way?

EMILIA
Never

OTHELLO
To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing?

EMILIA
Never my lord

OTHELLO
Thats strange

EMILIA
I durst my lord to wager she is honest
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other
Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
If any wretch have put this in your head
Let heaven requite it with the serpents curse
For if she be not honest chaste and true
s no man happy The purest of  wives
Is foul as slander

OTHELLO
Bid her come hither Go

 [_Exit Emilia_]

She says enough Yet shes a simple bawd
That cannot say as much This is a subtle whore
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets
And yet shell kneel and pray I have seen her do t

  Desdemona and Emilia

DESDEMONA
My lord what is your will?

OTHELLO
Pray chuck come hither

DESDEMONA
What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO
Let me see your eyes
Look in my face

DESDEMONA
What horrible fancys this?

OTHELLO
[_To Emilia_] Some of your function mistress
Leave procreants alone and shut the door
Cough or cry hem if anybody come
Your mystery your mystery Nay dispatch

 [_Exit Emilia_]

DESDEMONA
Upon my knees what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words
But not the words

OTHELLO
Why what art thou?

DESDEMONA
Your wife my lord your true and loyal wife

OTHELLO
Come swear it damn thyself
Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
 fear to seize thee fore be double-damnd
Swear thou art honest

DESDEMONA
Heaven doth truly know it

OTHELLO
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell

DESDEMONA
To whom my lord? With whom? How am I false?

OTHELLO
O Desdemona away! away! away!

DESDEMONA
Alas the heavy day why do you weep?
Am I the motive of  tears my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back
Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him
Why I have lost him too

OTHELLO
Had it pleasd heaven
To try me with affliction had they raind
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
Steepd me in poverty to the very lips
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
I  have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience But alas to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at
Yet could I bear that too well very well:
But  where I have garnerd up my heart
Where either I must live or bear no life
The fountain from the  my current runs
Or else dries up to be discarded thence
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in!turn thy complexion 
Patience thou young and rose-lippd cherubin
Ay  look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest

OTHELLO
O ay as summer flies are in the shambles
That quicken even with blowing O thou weed
Who art so lovely fair and smellst so sweet
That the sense aches at thee
 thou hadst neer been born!

DESDEMONA
Alas what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO
Was this fair paper this most goodly book
Made to write whore upon? What committed?
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I  make very forges of my cheeks
That  to cinders burn up modesty
Did I but speak thy deeds What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks;
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hushd within the hollow mine of earth
And will not hear it What committed!
Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA
By heaven you do me wrong

OTHELLO
Are not you a strumpet?

DESDEMONA
No as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet I am none

OTHELLO
What not a whore?

DESDEMONA
No as I shall be savd

OTHELLO
Ist possible?

DESDEMONA
O heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO
I cry you mercy then
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with OthelloYou mistress

  Emilia

That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keeps the gate of hell You you ay you!
We have done our course; s money for your pains
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel

 [_Exit_]

EMILIA
Alas what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you madam? How do you my good lady?

DESDEMONA
Faith half asleep

EMILIA
Good madam whats the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA
With who?

EMILIA
Why with my lord madam

DESDEMONA
Who is thy lord?

EMILIA
He that is yours sweet lady

DESDEMONA
I have none Do not talk to me Emilia
I cannot weep nor answer have I none
But what  go by water Prithee tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets remember
And call thy husband hither

EMILIA
Heres a change indeed!

 [_Exit_]

DESDEMONA
Tis meet I  be usd so very meet
How have I been behavd that he might stick
The smallst opinion on my least misuse?

  Iago and Emilia

IAGO
What is your pleasure madam? How ist with you?

DESDEMONA
I cannot tell Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks
He might have chid me so for in good faith
I am a child to chiding

IAGO
Whats the matter lady?

EMILIA
Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhord her
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
As true hearts cannot bear

DESDEMONA
Am I that name Iago?

IAGO
What name fair lady?

DESDEMONA
Such as she says my lord did say I was

EMILIA
He calld her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet

IAGO
Why did he so?

DESDEMONA
I do not know I am sure I am none such

IAGO
Do not weep do not weep: alas the day!

EMILIA
Hath she forsook so many noble matches
Her father and her country and her friends
To be calld whore?  it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA
It is my wretched fortune

IAGO
Beshrew him fort!
How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA
Nay heaven doth know

EMILIA
I will be hangd if some eternal villain
Some busy and insinuating rogue
Some cogging cozening slave to get some office
Have not devisd this slander Ill be hangd else

IAGO
Fie  is no such man It is impossible

DESDEMONA
If any such  be heaven pardon him!

EMILIA
A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones!
Why  he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moors abused by some most villainous knave
Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
O heaven that such companions thoudst unfold
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

IAGO
Speak within door

EMILIA
O fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turnd your wit the seamy side without
And made you to suspect me with the Moor

IAGO
You are a fool Go to

DESDEMONA
Alas Iago
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend go to him For by this light of heaven
I know not how I lost him Here I kneel
If eer my will did trespass gainst his love
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
Delighted them in any other form
Or that I do not yet and ever did
And ever will (though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement) love him dearly
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life
But never taint my love I cannot say whore
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the worlds mass of vanity could make me

IAGO
I pray you be content Tis but his humour
The business of the state does him offence
And he does chide with you

DESDEMONA
If twere no other

IAGO
Tis but so I warrant

 [_Trumpets within_]

Hark how  instruments summon to supper
The messengers of Venice stay the meat
Go in and weep not All things shall be well

 [_Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia_]

  Roderigo

How now Roderigo?

RODERIGO
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me

IAGO
What in the contrary?

RODERIGO
Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago and rather as it
seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me with
the least advantage of hope I will indeed no longer endure it Nor am
I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly
suffered

IAGO
Will you hear me Roderigo?

RODERIGO
Faith I have heard too much for your words and performances are no
kin together

IAGO
You charge me most unjustly

RODERIGO
With naught but truth I have wasted myself out of my means The jewels
you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona  half have corrupted
a votarist: you have told me she hath received them and returned me
expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance but I
find none

IAGO
Well go to very well

RODERIGO
Very well go to I cannot go to man nor tis not very well Nay I
say tis very scurvy and begin to find myself fopped in it

IAGO
Very well

RODERIGO
I tell you tis not very well I will make myself known to Desdemona
If she will return me my jewels I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation If not assure yourself I will seek satisfaction
of you

IAGO
You have said now

RODERIGO
Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing

IAGO
Why now I see s mettle in thee and even from this instant do
build on thee a better opinion than ever before Give me thy hand
Roderigo Thou hast taken against me a most just exception but yet I
protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair

RODERIGO
It hath not appeared

IAGO
I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is not without
wit and judgement But Roderigo if thou hast that in thee indeed
 I have greater reason to believe now than everI mean purpose
courage and valourthis night show it If thou the next night
following enjoy not Desdemona take me from this world with treachery
and devise engines for my life

RODERIGO
Well what is it? Is it within reason and compass?

IAGO
Sir  is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in
Othellos place

RODERIGO
Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice

IAGO
O no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair
Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein
none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio

RODERIGO
How do you mean removing of him?

IAGO
Why by making him uncapable of Othellos place: knocking out his
brains

RODERIGO
And that you  have me to do?

IAGO
Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right He sups tonight with
a harlotry and thither will I go to him He knows not yet of his
honourable fortune If you will watch his going thence  I will
fashion to fall out between twelve and one you may take him at your
pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt and he shall fall
between us Come stand not amazed at it but go along with me I will
show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself
bound to put it on him It is now high supper-time and the night grows
to waste About it

RODERIGO
I will hear further reason for this

IAGO
And you shall be satisfied

 [_Exeunt_]

 [_Exeunt Othello Lodovico and Attendants_]

EMILIA
How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did

DESDEMONA
He says he will return incontinent
He hath commanded me to go to bed
And bade me to dismiss you

EMILIA
Dismiss me?

DESDEMONA
It was his bidding fore good Emilia
Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
We must not now displease him

EMILIA
I  you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA
So  not I My love doth so approve him
That even his stubbornness his checks his frowns
Prithee unpin mehave grace and favour in them

EMILIA
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed

DESDEMONA
Alls one Good faith how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me
In one of those same sheets

EMILIA
Come come you talk

DESDEMONA
My mother had a maid calld Barbary
She was in love and he she lovd provd mad
And did forsake her She had a song of willow
An old thing twas but it expressd her fortune
And she died singing it That song tonight
Will not go from my mind I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poor Barbary Prithee dispatch

EMILIA
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA
No unpin me here
This Lodovico is a proper man

EMILIA
A very handsome man

DESDEMONA
He speaks well

EMILIA
I know a lady in Venice  have walked barefoot to Palestine for a
touch of his nether lip

DESDEMONA
[_Singing_]
    _The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree
        Sing all a green willow
    Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
        Sing willow willow willow
    The fresh streams ran by her and murmurd her moans
        Sing willow willow willow;
    Her salt tears fell from her and softend the stones;_

Lay by :

[_Sings_]
        _Sing willow willow willow_

Prithee hie thee Hell come anon

[_Sings_]
    _Sing all a green willow must be my garland
Let nobody blame him his scorn I approve_

Nay thats not next Hark! who ist that knocks?

EMILIA
Its the wind

DESDEMONA
[_Sings_]
    _I calld my love false love; but what said he then?
        Sing willow willow willow:
    If I court mo women youll couch with mo men_

So get thee gone; good night Mine eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?

EMILIA
Tis neither here nor 

DESDEMONA
I have heard it said so O  men  men!
Dost thou in conscience thinktell me Emilia
That  be women do abuse  husbands
In such gross kind?

EMILIA
 be some such no question

DESDEMONA
st thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA
Why  not you?

DESDEMONA
No by this heavenly light!

EMILIA
Nor I neither by this heavenly light
I might dot as well i the dark

DESDEMONA
st thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA
The worlds a huge thing It is a great price
For a small vice

DESDEMONA
In troth I think thou st not

EMILIA
In troth I think I  and undot when I had done Marry I 
not do such a thing for a joint-ring nor for measures of lawn nor for
gowns petticoats nor caps nor any petty exhibition; but for the
whole worldwhy who  not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I  venture purgatory for t

DESDEMONA
Beshrew me if I  do such a wrong for the whole world

EMILIA
Why the wrong is but a wrong i the world; and having the world for
your labour tis a wrong in your own world and you might quickly make
it right

DESDEMONA
I do not think  is any such woman

EMILIA
Yes a dozen; and as many to the vantage as  store the world they
played for
But I do think it is  husbands faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack  duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps;
Or else break out in peevish jealousies
Throwing restraint upon us Or say they strike us
Or scant our former having in despite
Why we have galls; and though we have some grace
Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
 wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have  palates both for sweet and sour
As husbands have What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth Ist frailty that thus errs?
It is so too And have not we affections
Desires for sport and frailty as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know
The ills we do  ills instruct us so

DESDEMONA
Good night good night Heaven me such usage send
Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend!

 [_Exeunt_]



ACT V

SCENE I Cyprus A Street

  Iago and Roderigo

IAGO
Here stand behind this bulk Straight will he come
Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home
Quick quick fear nothing; Ill be at thy elbow
It makes us or it mars us think on that
And fix most firm thy resolution

RODERIGO
Be near at hand I may miscarry in t

IAGO
Here at thy hand Be bold and take thy stand

 [_Retires to a little distance_]

RODERIGO
I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons
Tis but a man gone Forth my sword; he dies

 [_Goes to his stand_]

IAGO
I have rubbd this young quat almost to the sense
And he grows angry Now whether he kill Cassio
Or Cassio him or each do kill the other
Every way makes my gain Live Roderigo
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobbd from him
As gifts to Desdemona
It must not be If Cassio do remain
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly And besides the Moor
May unfold me to him;  stand I in much peril
No he must die But so I hear him coming

  Cassio

RODERIGO
I know his gait; tis he Villain thou diest!

 [_Rushes out and makes a pass at Cassio_]

CASSIO
That thrust had been mine enemy indeed
But that my coat is better than thou knowst
I will make proof of thine

SCENE II Cyprus A Bedchamber in the castle

Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning

  Othello

OTHELLO
It is the cause it is the cause my soul
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars!
It is the cause Yet Ill not shed her blood
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster
Yet she must die else shell betray more men
Put out the light and then put out the light:
If I quench thee thou flaming minister
I can again thy former light restore
 I repent me But once put out thy light
Thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume When I have pluckd thy rose
I cannot give it vital growth again
It must needs wither Ill smell it on the tree

 [_Kissing her_]

O balmy breath that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more one more
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
And love thee after One more and this the last
So sweet was neer so fatal I must weep
But they are cruel tears This sorrows heavenly
It strikes where it doth love She wakes

DESDEMONA
Whos ? Othello?

OTHELLO
Ay Desdemona

DESDEMONA
Will you come to bed my lord?

OTHELLO
Have you prayd tonight Desdemona?

Unreconcild as yet to heaven and grace

OTHELLO
Sweet soul take heed take heed of perjury

DESDEMONA

For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal Thou art to die

DESDEMONA
Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life	 never lovd Cassio

And makst me call what I intend to do
A murder  I thought a sacrifice

Still as the grave Shall she come in? Weret good?
I think she stirs again; no Whats best to do?
If she come in shell sure speak to my wife
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife

Methinks it  be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
 yawn at alteration

EMILIA
[_Within_] I do beseech you
That I may speak with you O good my lord!

OTHELLO
I had forgot thee: O come in Emilia
Soft by and by; let me the curtains draw

  Emilia

EMILIA

And makes men mad

EMILIA
Cassio my lord hath killd a young Venetian
Calld Roderigo

OTHELLO
Roderigo killd?
And Cassio killd?

EMILIA

DESDEMONA
O falsely falsely murderd!

EMILIA
Alas what cry is that?

OTHELLO

EMILIA
Out and alas! That was my ladys voice
Help! help ho! help! O lady speak again

OTHELLO

Twas I that killd her

EMILIA
O the more angel she
And you the blacker devil!

OTHELLO
She turnd to folly and she was a whore

EMILIA
Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil

OTHELLO
She was false as water

EMILIA
Thou art rash as fire to say
That she was false: O she was heavenly true!

OTHELLO
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else
O I were damnd beneath all depth in hell
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity Thy husband knew it all

EMILIA
My husband?

OTHELLO
Thy husband

EMILIA
That she was false to wedlock?

OTHELLO
Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true
If heaven  make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite
Id not have sold her for it

EMILIA
My husband?

OTHELLO
Ay twas he that told me first
An honest man he is and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds

EMILIA
My husband?

OTHELLO
What needs this iterance woman? I say thy husband

EMILIA
O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love!
My husband say that she was false?

OTHELLO
He woman;

My friend thy husband honest honest Iago

EMILIA
If he say so may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain

OTHELLO
Ha!

EMILIA
Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her

OTHELLO
Peace you were best

EMILIA
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed
(I care not for thy sword) Ill make thee known
Though I lost twenty lives Help! help ho! help!
The Moor hath killd my mistress! Murder murder!

  Montano Gratiano and Iago

MONTANO

EMILIA

Upon my soul a lie; a wicked lie
She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?

IAGO

Perchance Iago I will neer go home

OTHELLO
O! O! O!

 [_Hanging over his wife_]

EMILIA
Nay lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast killd the sweetest innocent
That eer did lift up eye

OTHELLO
[_Rising_] O she was foul!
I scarce did know you uncle  lies your niece
Whose breath indeed  hands have newly stoppd
I know this act shows horrible and grim

GRATIANO
Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy fathers dead
Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now
This sight  make him do a desperate turn
Yea curse his better angel from his side
And fall to reprobance

OTHELLO
Tis pitiful But yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed; Cassio confessd it
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
 I first gave her; I saw it in his hand
It was a handkerchief an antique token
My father gave my mother

EMILIA
O heaven! O heavenly powers!

IAGO
Come hold your peace

EMILIA
Twill out twill out I peace?
No I will speak as liberal as the north
Let heaven and men and devils let them all
All all cry shame against me yet Ill speak

IAGO
Be wise and get you home

EMILIA
I will not

 [_Iago offers to stab his wife_]

GRATIANO
Fie!
Your sword upon a woman?

EMILIA
O thou dull Moor that handkerchief thou speakst of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often with a solemn earnestness
More than indeed belongd to such a trifle
He beggd of me to steal it

IAGO
Villanous whore!

EMILIA
She give it Cassio! no alas I found it
And I did givet my husband

IAGO
Filth thou liest!

EMILIA
By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
O murderous coxcomb! What  such a fool
Do with so good a wife?


OTHELLO
Are  not stones in heaven
But what serve for thunder? Precious villain!

 [_Iago stabs Emilia and then runs out_]

GRATIANO
The woman falls Sure he hath killd his wife

EMILIA
Ay ay O lay me by my mistress side

GRATIANO
Hes gone but his wifes killd

MONTANO
Tis a notorious villain Take you this weapon
 I have here recoverd from the Moor
Come guard the door without let him not pass
But kill him rather Ill after that same villain
For tis a damned slave

 [_Exit Montano and Gratiano_]

OTHELLO
I am not valiant neither
But every puny whipster gets my sword
But why  honour outlive honesty?
Let it go all

EMILIA
What did thy song bode lady?
Hark canst thou hear me? I will play the swan
And die in music
[_Sings_] _Willow willow willow_
Moor she was chaste She lovd thee cruel Moor
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true;
So speaking as I think I die I die

 [_She dies_]

OTHELLO
I have another weapon in this chamber
It is a sword of Spain the ice-brooks temper
O here it is Uncle I must come forth

GRATIANO
[_Within_] If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear;
Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer

OTHELLO
Look in upon me then and speak with me
Or naked as I am I will assault thee

  Gratiano

GRATIANO
What is the matter?

OTHELLO
Behold I have a weapon
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldiers thigh: I have seen the day
That with this little arm and this good sword
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop But O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? Tis not so now
Be not afraid though you do see me weapond
Here is my journeys end here is my butt
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail
Do you go back dismayd? Tis a lost fear
Man but a rush against Othellos breast
And he retires Where  Othello go?
Now how dost thou look now? O ill-starrd wench
Pale as thy smock when we shall meet at compt
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl!
Even like thy chastity
O cursed cursed slave! Whip me ye devils
From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds roast me in sulphur
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemon! Dead Desdemon! dead! Oh oh!

  Lodovico Montano Cassio carried in a chair and Officers with
 Iago prisoner

LODOVICO
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

OTHELLO
Thats he that was Othello Here I am

LODOVICO
Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth

OTHELLO
I look down towards his feet; but thats a fable
If that thou best a devil I cannot kill thee

 [_Wounds Iago_]

LODOVICO
Wrench his sword from him

IAGO
I bleed sir but not killd

OTHELLO
I am not sorry neither Id have thee live
For in my sense tis happiness to die

LODOVICO
O thou Othello that wert once so good
Falln in the practice of a damned slave
What shall be said to thee?

OTHELLO
Why anything;
An honourable murderer if you will
For naught did I in hate but all in honour

LODOVICO
This wretch hath part confessd his villany
Did you and he consent in Cassios death?

OTHELLO
Ay

CASSIO
Dear general I never gave you cause

OTHELLO
I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Will you I pray demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnard my soul and body?

IAGO
Demand me nothing What you know you know
From this time forth I never will speak word

LODOVICO
What not to pray?

GRATIANO
Torments will ope your lips

OTHELLO
Well thou dost best

LODOVICO
Sir you shall understand what hath befalln
 as I think you know not Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo
And here another The one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo

OTHELLO
O villain!

CASSIO
Most heathenish and most gross!

LODOVICO
Now heres another discontented paper
Found in his pocket too; and this it seems
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him

OTHELLO
O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief
That was my wifes?

CASSIO
I found it in my chamber
And he himself confessd but even now
That  he droppd it for a special purpose
 wrought to his desire

OTHELLO
O fool! fool! fool!

CASSIO
 is besides in Roderigos letter
How he upbraids Iago that he made him
Brave me upon the watch whereon it came
That I was cast And even but now he spake
After long seeming dead Iago hurt him
Iago set him on

LODOVICO
You must forsake this room and go with us
Your power and your command is taken off
And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave
If  be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long
It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state Come bring away

OTHELLO
Soft you; a word or two before you go
I have done the state some service and they knowt
No more of that I pray you in your letters
When you shall  unlucky deeds relate
Speak of me as I am Nothing extenuate
Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought
Perplexd in the extreme; of one whose hand
Like the base Judean threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdud eyes
Albeit unused to the melting mood
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
 medicinal gum Set you down this
And say besides that in Aleppo once
Where a malignant and a turband Turk
Beat a Venetian and traducd the state
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him thus

 [_Stabs himself_]

LODOVICO
O bloody period!

GRATIANO
All thats spoke is marrd

OTHELLO
I kissd thee ere I killd thee No way but this
Killing myself to die upon a kiss

 [_Falling upon Desdemona_]

CASSIO
This did I fear but thought he had no weapon
For he was great of heart

LODOVICO
[_To Iago_] O Spartan dog
More fell than anguish hunger or the sea
Look on the tragic loading of this bed
This is thy work The object poisons sight
Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor
For they succeed on you To you lord governor
Remains the censure of this hellish villain
The time the place the torture O enforce it!
Myself will straight aboard and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate

 [_Exeunt_]
